NULL (default), CRS inherited spatial input. input also lacks CRS, function stop error. output_type class output object: \"sf_polygons\" (default) creates spatial object polygon geometries, \"sf_points\" creates sf object point geometries, \"dataframe\" creates data frame grid cell centroid coordinates (X_centroid, Y_centroid), \"spatraster\" creates terra::SpatRaster object grid cell IDs stored factor levels (Raster Attribute Table). Note: \"spatraster\" supported inspire_grid_from_extent(), inspire_grid_from_ids(). clip_to_input logical value.
